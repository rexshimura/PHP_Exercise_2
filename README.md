INSTRUCTIONS:

For this exercise, you will use a list of ten of the largest cities in the world.
(Please note, these are not the ten largest, just a selection of ten from the
largest cities.) Create an array with the following values: 
( Tokyo, Mexico, City, New York City, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Lagos, Buenos Aires, Cairo, London. )

Print these values to the browser separated by commas, using a loop to iterate over
the array. Sort the array, then print the values to the browser in an unordered list, again using a loop.

Add the following cities to the array: 
( Los Angeles, Calcutta, Osaka, Beijing. )

Sort the array again, and print it once more to the browser in an unordered list.
